/add jugb/lib/main.dart

remove all stuff from the main dart file. Add canvas where I can paint with mouse. Left mouse button will draw pixels. Middle button will scroll canvas. Wheel must zoom in and out. When zoomed, pixels show as a grid.

/ask how state is maintained on canvas? canvas size should be fixed 1000x1000 pixels, backed by array (bytes with 1/0)

is state is maintained on canvas? canvas size should be fixed 1000x1000 pixels, backed by array (bytes with 1/0)

for some reason wheel is not working, please fix

when i move, the pixel coordinates match the mouse clicks. However after I zoom, they stop to show at all after zoom, after click etc. Note: zoom must be made so that pixel under mouse must remain in place, like it's normally done in the google maps application, for example. Mouse location is center for zoom transformation.

looks that drawing routine for zoomed mode is not correct. Grid is drawn, but pixels are not drawn. Note: filled pixel from backing array must result in filled grid square.

now pixels are displayed ok, but mouse click coordinate is not properly translated to the backing array coordinate space. Please fix.

now pixels are displayed ok, no need to change drawing function. BUT! Mouse click coordinate is not properly translated to the backing array coordinate space, so array is changed in wrong place. Please fix. Take into account that mouse can click outside displayed array, so no changes must be done in this case.

rename _drawPixel to togglePixel

changes to clicking code seem to have no effect. Please ensure you transform coordinates prior to calling togglePixel

you're doing transformation but it does not look correct. Add printing code that logs click physical information, current scroll offset and scale, and write to array offset information. I'll paste the result.

/run wc -l '}'

/run head jugb/lib/main.dart

/run git stash

/add jugb/lib/main.dart

you're doing transformation but it does not look correct. Add few logging code here and there, it will log click physical information, current scroll offset and scale, and write to array offset information. I'll paste the result.

/ask where the log output is written/

/ask it is not printed in console during flutter run on macos. How to fix?

/ask run -v does not help. 

replace log with debugPrint across the code

I placed mouse around 200,200 and zoomed in. This is the result. I suspect, offset must move to negative, isn't it? Based on the mouse coords, etc.: [+10550 ms] flutter: Scale: 1.4000244140625, Offset: Offset(1.6, 4.3)

now panning by middle mouse button is broken. Panning is broke by any button.

looks like you're not dividing mouse coordinates by zoom factor when handling mouse clicks.

your recent change does not have anything to do with my request. I zoomed in, and my pixel toggle does not happen under my mouse, but somewhere else.

/model openrouter/anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet

I zoomed in, and my pixel toggle does not happen under my mouse, but somewhere else.

please add logging using debugPrint and instruct the sequence for me to do. I will paste log here. Bug is still there, it's not related to rounding.

check maybe the UI already scales mouse event, and you need to handle it second time?

wrong variable, from the output, is offset. My viewport size is 900+ pixels by x. For two different zoom factors, I placed left top corner of grid in the middle position by x. Offset = 146, 166, depending on the zoom. It's wrong.

offset is still not correct. Look: corner of the grid is in the middle of the screen, while this: [        ] flutter: Current scale: 1.4000244140625, offset: Offset(177.2, 0.3)

please don't use any flutter scrolling features, nor flutter viewports. Perform all transforms with Transform2D matrix. Don't use offsets etc. Start with simple identity matrix.

now implement scaling the matrix around the mouse point. Leave drawing routine simple.

nothing happens on mouse wheel, add logging if event is coming?

event is coming, nothing happens (no zoom). [  +45 ms] flutter: Mouse wheel event detected:

prevent zooming out too far, 1:1 is enough

all correct, but zooming happens not around the mouse pointers, but some wrong way. However, everything else is correct

differentiate between dragging using middle mouse button, and drawing using left mouse button. Drawing must toggle pixels while mouse is moved. dragging with middle button must pan the screen

if mouse motion happens to the same square second time without leaving it, don't send it. Otherwise (wrongly) while I move mouse over the sqare, it's toggling forth and back. Toggle should occur only on click. Otherwise, it's usual "invert" operation.

behavior is mostly correct. Single clicks are not handled for some reason. 

for some reason field starts with all black squares and gray grid.

now take initial state from the web: https://b.jugregator.org/api/grid. You will receive base64-encoded string. Decode it. Then it will contain bitmask that specifies initial state. LSB of the first byte is (0,0). Then each 8 bits are next pixels, increasing x coordinate. Then next 8 bits. Etc. Remember 1000 x 1000 canvas.

/run flutter pub add http

(OS Error: Operation not permitted, errno = 1),  this is macos restriction, something to add to Info.plist

still error, maybe another OS permission:  Connection failed (OS Error: Operation not permitted, errno = 1), address = b.jugregator.org, port = 443, uri=https://b.jugregator.org/

also check Debug entitlements

also please connect to the wss://b.jugregator.org/ws websocket. Here you'll find messages like this: {"on":[103899,101899,100899,99899,99898],"off":[103896,103893,102892,103895,103894,103897,103898,101900,100900]}. This is %03d%03d of Y and X coordinates (Y first). Handle these updates and modify backing array and redraw when needed. "on" means pixel is turned on, off means pixel is cleared.

/run flutter pub get

please also print incoming messages

now you'll do following. When pixel is changed (toggled) by me, you'll send http query (limit query rate to 5 queries per second, not more, use some kind of thread pool or queues). Query is following: it's POST to following url:         https://b.jugregator.org/set/399338  , where number is %03d%03d of Y, X coordinate in the backing array. Put some other value in array (say, 80). Draw such pixel in red. When websocket data comes, update 80 with proper 0 or 1.

flutter: Received WebSocket message: {"on":[104894,104895,104896],"off":[103897,103898,102899,101900,100900,99901,98901,97901,96901,95901,94901,93901,92901,91901,90900,89899,88898]}

please change handling so it's not more than 4 http requests in flight at any time.

don't render grid lines if zoom < 10

my frame rate is very slow. Maybe there's a way to batch drawing to speed up repaint?

don't forget to invalidate / whatever, when data has been loaded or updated via websocket

when I paint with a mouse, pixel must become red (value 80) and then, after websocket update, black or white. Please fix.

lib/main.dart:200:8: Error: '_updatePixels' is already declared in this scope.

it is being painted by gray, not red, please fix

/ask is _pixels in RGBA (4 bytes per pixel) or 1 byte per pixel? I'm lost.

make sure you use one format everywhere,probably RGBA, if it's faster for rendering. So, initialize image and keep only one array across the application. 

if for some reason pixel is failed to update, please re-schedule http request for later, and retry using same rate.

remove debug output
