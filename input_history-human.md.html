<p>/ask how to run on macos? using flutter command</p>
<p>/add jugb/lib/main.dart</p>
<p>remove all stuff from the main dart file. Add canvas where I can
paint with mouse. Left mouse button will draw pixels. Middle button will
scroll canvas. Wheel must zoom in and out. When zoomed, pixels show as a
grid.</p>
<p>/ask how state is maintained on canvas? canvas size should be fixed
1000x1000 pixels, backed by array (bytes with 1/0)</p>
<p>is state is maintained on canvas? canvas size should be fixed
1000x1000 pixels, backed by array (bytes with 1/0)</p>
<p>for some reason wheel is not working, please fix</p>
<p>when i move, the pixel coordinates match the mouse clicks. However
after I zoom, they stop to show at all after zoom, after click etc.
Note: zoom must be made so that pixel under mouse must remain in place,
like it’s normally done in the google maps application, for example.
Mouse location is center for zoom transformation.</p>
<p>looks that drawing routine for zoomed mode is not correct. Grid is
drawn, but pixels are not drawn. Note: filled pixel from backing array
must result in filled grid square.</p>
<p>now pixels are displayed ok, but mouse click coordinate is not
properly translated to the backing array coordinate space. Please
fix.</p>
<p>now pixels are displayed ok, no need to change drawing function. BUT!
Mouse click coordinate is not properly translated to the backing array
coordinate space, so array is changed in wrong place. Please fix. Take
into account that mouse can click outside displayed array, so no changes
must be done in this case.</p>

<p>rename _drawPixel to togglePixel</p>
<p>changes to clicking code seem to have no effect. Please ensure you
transform coordinates prior to calling togglePixel</p>
<p>you’re doing transformation but it does not look correct. Add
printing code that logs click physical information, current scroll
offset and scale, and write to array offset information. I’ll paste the
result.</p>
<p>/run wc -l ‘}’</p>
<p>/run head jugb/lib/main.dart</p>
<p>/run git stash</p>
<p>/add jugb/lib/main.dart</p>
<p>you’re doing transformation but it does not look correct. Add few
logging code here and there, it will log click physical information,
current scroll offset and scale, and write to array offset information.
I’ll paste the result.</p>
<p>/ask where the log output is written/</p>
<p>/ask it is not printed in console during flutter run on macos. How to
fix?</p>
<p>/ask run -v does not help.</p>
<p>replace log with debugPrint across the code</p>
<p>I placed mouse around 200,200 and zoomed in. This is the result. I
suspect, offset must move to negative, isn’t it? Based on the mouse
coords, etc.: [+10550 ms] flutter: Scale: 1.4000244140625, Offset:
Offset(1.6, 4.3)</p>
<p>now panning by middle mouse button is broken. Panning is broke by any
button.</p>
<p>looks like you’re not dividing mouse coordinates by zoom factor when
handling mouse clicks.</p>
<p>your recent change does not have anything to do with my request. I
zoomed in, and my pixel toggle does not happen under my mouse, but
somewhere else.</p>

<p>/add jugb/lib/main.dart</p>
<p>I zoomed in, and my pixel toggle does not happen under my mouse, but
somewhere else.</p>
<p>please add logging using debugPrint and instruct the sequence for me
to do. I will paste log here. Bug is still there, it’s not related to
rounding.</p>
<p>check maybe the UI already scales mouse event, and you need to handle
it second time?</p>
<p>wrong variable, from the output, is offset. My viewport size is 900+
pixels by x. For two different zoom factors, I placed left top corner of
grid in the middle position by x. Offset = 146, 166, depending on the
zoom. It’s wrong.</p>
<p>offset is still not correct. Look: corner of the grid is in the
middle of the screen, while this: [ ] flutter: Current scale:
1.4000244140625, offset: Offset(177.2, 0.3)</p>
<p>please don’t use any flutter scrolling features, nor flutter
viewports. Perform all transforms with Transform2D matrix. Don’t use
offsets etc. Start with simple identity matrix.</p>
<p>now implement scaling the matrix around the mouse point. Leave
drawing routine simple.</p>
<p>nothing happens on mouse wheel, add logging if event is coming?</p>
<p>event is coming, nothing happens (no zoom). [ +45 ms] flutter: Mouse
wheel event detected:</p>
<p>prevent zooming out too far, 1:1 is enough</p>
<p>all correct, but zooming happens not around the mouse pointers, but
some wrong way. However, everything else is correct</p>
<p>differentiate between dragging using middle mouse button, and drawing
using left mouse button. Drawing must toggle pixels while mouse is
moved. dragging with middle button must pan the screen</p>
<p>if mouse motion happens to the same square second time without
leaving it, don’t send it. Otherwise (wrongly) while I move mouse over
the sqare, it’s toggling forth and back. Toggle should occur only on
click. Otherwise, it’s usual “invert” operation.</p>
<p>behavior is mostly correct. Single clicks are not handled for some
reason.</p>
<p>for some reason field starts with all black squares and gray
grid.</p>
<p>now take initial state from the web:
https://b.jugregator.org/api/grid. You will receive base64-encoded
string. Decode it. Then it will contain bitmask that specifies initial
state. LSB of the first byte is (0,0). Then each 8 bits are next pixels,
increasing x coordinate. Then next 8 bits. Etc. Remember 1000 x 1000
canvas.</p>

<p>/run flutter pub add http</p>
<p>(OS Error: Operation not permitted, errno = 1), this is macos
restriction, something to add to Info.plist</p>
<p>still error, maybe another OS permission: Connection failed (OS
Error: Operation not permitted, errno = 1), address = b.jugregator.org,
port = 443, uri=https://b.jugregator.org/</p>
<p>also check Debug entitlements</p>
<p>also please connect to the wss://b.jugregator.org/ws websocket. Here
you’ll find messages like this:
{“on”:[103899,101899,100899,99899,99898],“off”:[103896,103893,102892,103895,103894,103897,103898,101900,100900]}.
This is %03d%03d of Y and X coordinates (Y first). Handle these updates
and modify backing array and redraw when needed. “on” means pixel is
turned on, off means pixel is cleared.</p>
<p>/run flutter pub get</p>
<p>please also print incoming messages</p>
<p>now you’ll do following. When pixel is changed (toggled) by me,
you’ll send http query (limit query rate to 5 queries per second, not
more, use some kind of thread pool or queues). Query is following: it’s
POST to following url: https://b.jugregator.org/set/399338 , where
number is %03d%03d of Y, X coordinate in the backing array. Put some
other value in array (say, 80). Draw such pixel in red. When websocket
data comes, update 80 with proper 0 or 1.</p>
<p>flutter: Received WebSocket message:
{“on”:[104894,104895,104896],“off”:[103897,103898,102899,101900,100900,99901,98901,97901,96901,95901,94901,93901,92901,91901,90900,89899,88898]}</p>
<p>please change handling so it’s not more than 4 http requests in
flight at any time.</p>
<p>don’t render grid lines if zoom &lt; 10</p>
<p>my frame rate is very slow. Maybe there’s a way to batch drawing to
speed up repaint?</p>
<p>don’t forget to invalidate / whatever, when data has been loaded or
updated via websocket</p>
<p>when I paint with a mouse, pixel must become red (value 80) and then,
after websocket update, black or white. Please fix.</p>
<p>lib/main.dart:200:8: Error: ’_updatePixels’ is already declared in
this scope.</p>
<p>it is being painted by gray, not red, please fix</p>
<p>/ask is _pixels in RGBA (4 bytes per pixel) or 1 byte per pixel? I’m
lost.</p>
<p>make sure you use one format everywhere,probably RGBA, if it’s faster
for rendering. So, initialize image and keep only one array across the
application.</p>
<p>if for some reason pixel is failed to update, please re-schedule http
request for later, and retry using same rate.</p>
<p>remove debug output</p>
